### ðŸŽµ Audio Source

The piano sounds in this app are sourced from the [3D Piano Player](https://github.com/reality3d/3d-piano-player) repository.

### ðŸŽ¹ Why computer Keyboard Keys Are Not Used

This project does not include support for playing piano notes using computer keyboard keys because standard keyboards do not have enough keys to match a full piano layout. Instead, clicking on the on-screen keys is required to play sounds.
